# filesystem
A Scala filesystem CLI.

This program is an exercise from the Rock the JVM! Scala and Functional Programming for Beginners
course on Udemy.

However, I ended up using it mainly as an excuse to learn some CI (CircleCI, scalafmt, codecov, 
ScalaTest). I abandoned the project when I decided to move on to underscore.io's Essential Scala 
curriculum instead, on the advice of the Scala room on the Functional Programming discord channel.
